abstract = {We present a reversible Polymorphism-Aware Phylogenetic Model (revPoMo) for species tree estimation from genome-wide data. revPoMo enables the reconstruction of large scale species trees for many within-species samples. It expands the alphabet of DNA substitution models to include polymorphic states, thereby, naturally accounting for incomplete lineage sorting. We implemented revPoMo in the maximum likelihood software IQ-TREE. A simulation study and an application to great apes data show that the runtimes of our approach and standard substitution models are comparable but that revPoMo has much better accuracy in estimating trees, divergence times and mutation rates. The advantage of revPoMo is that an increase of sample size per species improves estimations but does not increase runtime. Therefore, revPoMo is a valuable tool with several applications, from speciation dating to species tree reconstruction.}

	abstract = {Introgression creates complex, non-bifurcating relationships among species. At individual loci and across the genome, both introgression and incomplete lineage sorting interact to produce a wide range of different gene tree topologies. These processes can obscure the history of speciation among lineages, and, as a result, identifying the history of speciation vs. introgression remains a challenge. Here, we use theory and simulation to investigate how introgression can mislead multiple approaches to species tree inference. We find that arbitrarily low amounts of introgression can mislead both gene tree methods and parsimony methods if the rate of incomplete lineage sorting is sufficiently high. We also show that an alternative approach based on minimum gene tree node heights is inconsistent and depends on the rate of introgression across the genome. To distinguish between speciation and introgression, we apply supervised machine learning models to a set of features that can easily be obtained from phylogenomic datasets. We find that multiple of these models are highly accurate in classifying the species history in simulated datasets. We also show that, if the histories of speciation and introgression can be identified, PhyloNet will return highly accurate estimates of the contribution of each history to the data (i.e. edge weights). Overall, our results highlight the promise of supervised machine learning as a potentially powerful complement to phylogenetic methods in the analysis of introgression from genomic data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = "{Phylogenomics has revealed the remarkable frequency with which introgression occurs across the tree of life. These discoveries have been enabled by the rapid growth of methods designed to detect and characterize introgression from whole-genome sequencing data. A large class of phylogenomic methods makes use of data across species to infer and characterize introgression based on expectations from the multispecies coalescent. These methods range from simple tests, such as the D-statistic, to model-based approaches for inferring phylogenetic networks. Here, we provide a detailed overview of the various signals that different modes of introgression are expected leave in the genome, and how current methods are designed to detect them. We discuss the strengths and pitfalls of these approaches and identify areas for future development, highlighting the different signals of introgression, and the power of each method to detect them. We conclude with a discussion of current challenges in inferring introgression and how they could potentially be addressed.}",
